## Getting Started

We have a demo version of the platform on this url: <a href="https://regenwise.xyz">DemoUrl</a>

If you want to run the project on your local machine, read the steps below:

### Steps To Run The Web Platform On Your Local Machine

* First you should clone this repo to your local machine.
* After you get inside the cloned folder, you should go into the related folder with the command below:
  ```sh
  cd .\regenwise-frontend\
  ```
* Then you should install required packages with the command below:
  ```sh
  npm install
  ```
* If you do not already have it, install Metamask wallet to your browser. (You can find how to do these on the net, it is easy.)

* You should add .env file in .\regenwise-frontend\ directory and inside it there should be your testnet account's private key named as NEXT_PUBLIC_key1 .

* Then run the command below:
  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```
