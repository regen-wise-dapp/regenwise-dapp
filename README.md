<h2 align="center"> Summary of The RegenWise Web Platform Project</h2>

  <p align="center">
    Human actions have caused significant environmental degradation and serious harm to the inhabitants, now it is crucial for us to contribute to the process of regeneration. "Regeneration" in our context is a term used to describe the restoration and responsible utilization and management of environmental systems. Our regen (the short form of the word regeneration) platform aims to facilitate the regen efforts by offering various services and resources to its users. The platform's main database collection on regen concepts serves as the primary feature that informs about environmental responsibility and also directs individuals to actively contribute to the regen goal. In addition, the platform's NFT markets are another essential features that users may benefit from. The users can earn and trade valuable NFTs from the platform's regen collections while spending valuable time to learn and contribute. Additionally, we offer a unique learning experience through quests that educate users about regen concepts and practices in various fields.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Overview Of The Project
<div align="center">
<img  src="/regenwise-frontend/public/read/Cover1.png" alt="Cover">
</div>

RegenWise is a web platform that aims to educate and engage users in the concepts and practices of regeneration. It serves as a comprehensive platform that combines learning, project suggestions and support, interactive quests, and marketplaces for regenerative-themed non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

The primary goal of RegenWise is to educate users about regeneration, which refers to the restoration and responsible utilization and management of environmental systems. The web platform provides a user-friendly interface that offers a wide range of educational content, including concept explanations, regen NFTs. These resources cover various topics related to regeneration, such as regenerative education, regenerative nutrition, regenerative agriculture and so on.

To make the learning experience more interactive and engaging, RegenWise incorporates quests and word games into its platform. Collecting points via therse may result in meaningful gifts such as regen NFTs.

RegenWise also features marketplaces dedicated to regen-themed NFTs. NFTs are unique digital assets that can represent various forms of digital or tangible content. In the context of RegenWise, the marketplace offers NFTs related to regeneration, including artwork, collectibles, and even digital representations of regenerative efforts via Tokenized Regenerative Effort (TRE) Market. By using blockchain technology, the marketplace ensures the authenticity and ownership of these NFTs, allowing users to trade them within the platform.

The combination of education, quests, and the NFT marketplaces within RegenWise reveal a comprehensivexperience for users. It not only informs knowledge about regeneration but also directs individuals to actively contribute to regen efforts.
